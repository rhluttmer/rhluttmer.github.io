        <main>
            <h4>What is Quiz Bowl?</h4>
                <p>From the <a href="https://www.naqt.com/about/quiz-bowl.html">National Academic Quiz Tournament</a> Website: </p>
                <p>"Quiz bowl is a game in which two teams compete head-to-head to answer questions from all areas of knowledge, including history, literature, science, fine arts, current events, popular culture, sports, and more."</p>
                <p>"The defining feature of quiz bowl is the use of a 'buzzer system' that lets players interrupt the reading of a question when they know the answer. That element adds a dimension of confidence, anticipation, and rapid recall to a game about knowing facts. Those 'tossup' questions are answered individually, but doing so earns one's team a chance at a three-part 'bonus' question. Bonus questions are worth more points and allow collaboration, but are generally more difficult."</p>

            <h4>Playing Quiz Bowl</h4>
                <p>I've been playing quizbowl for seven years, since I was in 6th grade. I started out playing for the Richmond Middle School team, and now I play for the Hanover High School quiz bowl team. I specialize in math, science, art, and a little bit of literature and music. </p>

            <h4>Coaching Quiz Bowl</h4>
                <p>I also coach quiz bowl for the Richmond Middle School team. I love coaching quiz bowl because I find it rewarding to see players improve throughout the year. Often in the fall, we have students who are afraid to buzz in, but over time they become more confident, and by the end of the year they answer multiple questions each game. I also enjoy seeing the team as a whole improve, transforming from a bunch of individuals who criticize each other for incorrect answers to a cohesive, encouraging unit where every player has a specialty and everyone on the team knows who to turn to for a given answer. Furthermore, it’s amazing to watch the team progress throughout the years. When I was a team member in sixth grade, we placed 126th out of 128 teams at the national tournament, but recently, one of our teams was tied for 13th out of 176 teams.</p>

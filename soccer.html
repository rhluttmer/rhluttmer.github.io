        <h2>Soccer</h2>

        <p>I have been playing soccer since kindergarten. In high school, I played on the HHS Girl's JV2 team, and I was a captain of the team in 11th and 12th grade. I also spent a year playing for the women's soccer club of Beauzelle, France when I was in 10th grade. Here are pictures of me playing throughout the years:</p>

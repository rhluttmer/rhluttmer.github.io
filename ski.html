        <h2>Ski Coaching</h2>


        <p>I coach skiing through the Ford Sayre Memorial Ski Council. Here are the two programs I have coached for:</p>

        <h4>Racing Development (DEVO)</h4>
        <p>Since Freshman year, I have been coaching skiing in the Alpine Racing Development Program. The kids in this program are in Kindergarden through Third Grade, and we meet on Saturday and Sunday for three hours per day. We also occasionally have races or big mountain days (which is when we travel to bigger ski resorts for a day).</p>

        <h4>Alpine Recreation Program</h4>
        <p>As a Freshman and Junior, I worked as a High School Coach for the Ford Sayre Alpine Recreation Program, which is held on Wednesdays. I would have done that again Senior year, but the program was canceled because of Covid-19. In this program, I have coached kids in 1st through 7th grade.</p>
